        <p id="review">Like, oh my god. Let me tell you about these brightly colored tealights from ThatNostalgicCompany. Each one is like a time machine
        to my 90s childhood.  The pink smelled just like a bubblegum lip gloss; the green like Zebra Stripe gum, the red like Fruit Roll-Ups. 
        They even somehow captured the subtle aroma of Lisa Frank stickers and slap bracelets. I was transported back to food court at the mall 
        and the sticky floors of the arcade. Just be warned: prolonged exposure may induce an uncontrollable urge to dig out your old Tamagotchi and start quoting lines from 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112697/" target="_blank">"Clueless"</a>. 
        So, if you're ready to embrace your inner 90s kid and add a pop of color to your life, these tealights are the <span id="bomb">bomb-dot-com</span>. </p>
